# Welcome to My Portfolio  

Here I will showcase some of my game programming [projects](https://captainmeehan.github.io/studious-funicular/projects.html).
I am currently looking for an internship. I am interested in working with most things tied to game programming but my main intrests right now are:
- Networking
- Netcode
- Optimization

Feel free to [contact](https://captainmeehan.github.io/studious-funicular/contact.html) me!
